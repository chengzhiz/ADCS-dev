            <strong>Augmenting Designers</strong>
          </h1>

            <strong>What is the future of design?</strong> As computation turns
            our cars, speakers, and home appliances into robots, we are
            interested in how designers engage with new opportunities and
            challenges when creating interactive products. We work on developing
            interactive systems that enable designers to understand people,
            prototype new devices, and embed intelligence into products.
            Ultimatley, we look to help designers do what they do better.

            Our research explores many different design domains, with a strong
            focus on emerging areas such and interaction with autonomous
            physical systems, human-robot interaction, and human-AI interaction.
            We have done work around automotive user experience, interaction
            with conversational music systems, semi-automated farm equipment,
            new mobility technologies, and automated design tools. We are
            interested in undestanding and developing new methods and tools for
            all phases of the design process. To inform our research, we often
            collaborate with designers in industry. In turn, this contributes to
            professional design practice by introducing new methods and tools
            that allow designers to better connect with their users and to
            explore the future capabilities of intelligent systems.
